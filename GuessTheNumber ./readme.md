This project is a fun game that allows users to guess a number and computes a score corresponding to the number of guesses they've taken

Rules:
1) The user has to choose a number between 1 to 20
2) Once the user enters a number , he is presented with either one of the following statments :
  - Number entered is too low
  - Number entered is too high 
  - Right Guess
3) For too low to too high the score is deducted by 1(initially 20) and the user is given chances until the score becomes 0
4) The game also records your high score and also lets you try again by clicking on the again button
